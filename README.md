# Path finder
### Path finding and maze generating atgorithms visualisation

A single-page web application for visualising multiple path-finding and maze-generating algorithms on a grid.

## Features

1. Draw walls on a grid and move start and end points
2. Choose from different algorithms and watch as they solve your maze
3. Choose an algorithm and let it generate a maze for you
4. Choose animation speed or solve it instantly

## Maze-generating algorithms

- Recursive backtracker
- Recursive backtracker with splits
  - A modification leading to more complex mazes
- Hunt and kill
- Recursive division

## Path-finding algorithms

- Dijkstra
- A*
  - Distance from end heuritics
  - Distance + path length heuritics
